<!-- This file contains an assortment of things used solely for validation reporting.
      Each thing has one or more "evalrule" scripts that verify facets of each actor
      and report appropriate error messages if not satisfied.

     If you prefer, you could instead have a small number of things with numerous
     "evalrule" scripts associated with each. The approach used below is to have lots
     of things with scripts targeted at a narrow purpose, but there is no reason you
     couldn't have a few things with lots of scripts targeted as a wide range of
     purposes. By having lots of separate things, the name of each can be leveraged
     for use within the validation error report, which can often improve the clarity
     and usefulness of the validation messages.
